# High-School-Work
The various Java code contained in this repo is a collection of the work I did in high school. Topics range from recursion, trees, and 2D matricies. Please note this code is not perfect as it was done as high school assignments where readability and cleanliness were not valued. Some of the code began as starter code given from my teacher so that may explain a lot of weird things like the inconsistent file naming and random imports.
