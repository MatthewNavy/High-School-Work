This code finds out how many mooses are grouped together adjacently in a matrix. Ms represent mooses and the other letters represent other animals.
Feel free to alter moose.dat to test other input. I'm not sure why my teacher used mooses, as this code can apply to anything needing
to find groupings of data in a 2D array.
